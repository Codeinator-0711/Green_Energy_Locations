# Green_Energy_Locations
___
ðŸ’­  Idea: It is unclear where the optimal locations for wind and solar energy are. For example this could be a problem for homeowners who plan to build a solar system.  
ðŸ’¡  Potential solution: Analyze solar and wind data. Also consider infrastructure and legal requirements to create a map with optimal locations.
___

**First Ideas:**

Analyse wind and solar data
Look at legal requirements as well as meterological data (wind speeds, sunlight hours, etc.) and consisting infrastructure (high voltage lines)
Show these locations a map (Highlight the best locations with a colour-ranking)
Optional: Calculate the amout energy that can be produced at a specific location
Optional: Calculate the break even-point

**â†’ Goal: Recommend ideal locations for solar or wind parks**
