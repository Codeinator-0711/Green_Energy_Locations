# Green_Energy_Locations
___
ðŸ’­  Idea: It is unclear where the optimal locations for wind and solar energy are. For example this could be a problem for homeowners who plan to build a solar system.  
ðŸ’¡  Potential solution: Analyze solar and wind data. Also consider infrastructure and legal requirements to create a map with optimal locations.
___

**1. Idea and Goal:**

- Analyse wind and solar data
- Look at legal requirements as well as meterological data (wind speeds, sunlight hours, etc.) and consisting infrastructure (high voltage lines)
- Show these locations a map (Highlight the best locations with a colour-ranking)
- Optional: Calculate the amout energy that can be produced at a specific location
- Optional: Calculate the break even-point

**â†’ Goal: Recommend ideal locations for solar or wind parks**
___

**2. Methodological Approach:**


**Brainstorm**

1. DataFrame: (SÃ¶nke)
2. Solar-Model: (SÃ¶nke & Laura)
  - Which x-variables for the model: 
    - Solar: hours of sun
    - How many hours of sunlight is needed for a solar power plant?
    - Notebook for Data Preparation: http://tiny.cc/dataprep_tl
3. Wind-Model: (Simon)
  - Which x-variables for the model: average wind speed
  - How many hours of wind is needed for a wind mill? 4-25m/s (14,4-90kmh)   
4. Map: (Gabriel + Lena)
  - Map Expamples
5. Beispiel-Datensatz: (SÃ¶nke?)
6. Pitch/Presentation:
  - Powerpoint: Introduction
8. Ask TecLabs about presentation: (In Stand-Up on Sunday)
9. Project-Structure for different modules:
10. Setup Github structure: (Gabriel)
  - Iusses:
  - Cards on Kanban-Board
